# Compiler Project

**Formal Languages and Translation Techniques Course â€“ University Project**  
**Language:** C++ | **Tools:** Bison, Flex

## Overview

This project is a compiler for a custom **Pascal-like virtual language**, developed as part of a university course on Formal Languages and Translation Techniques. The compiler translates the high-level source code into an **assembly-like language** designed specifically for the course.

The final goal of the project was to produce **optimized** machine code for a provided virtual machine. Student compilers were evaluated and compared based on the **performance and efficiency** of the generated code.

### Build & Run

```bash
cd project
make
./kompilator <input file> <output file>
```
